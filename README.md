yHacks FinTech Application: The Ticker Picker

This application retrieves the 500 stocks tracked by the S&P500 index and runs them through a variety of indicators in order to perform a technical overview. The final result is the ability to view the highest rated stocks to buy or sell and subsequently view their individual indicator ratings, in order to make a decision.

Due to Wi-Fi limitations, the stock data is stored locally. However, an API is implemented that under less constraints would be able to dynamically retrieve information.

An intense amount of computations are involved in the analysis and as a result the script has a startup time of about 2 minutes.
